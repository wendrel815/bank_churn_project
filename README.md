### main points of the project report
- model in production, which will receive a customer base via API and will return this same “scored” base, that is, an extra column with the probability of each customer churn.

1. What is TopBank's current Churn rate?
2. What is the model's performance in classifying customers as **churns**?
3. What is the expected return, in terms of revenue, if the company uses its model to avoid **churn** from customers?
